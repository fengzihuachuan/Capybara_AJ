# Capybara_AJ

Capybara_AJ is an Android App designed for learning language speaking. 

It uses srt/ass subtitle files and video files, to enable a imitation environment.
The snapshot following shows how it looks like.

When the subtitle is clicked, the corresponding sentence of the video will be replayed.
You can also record your imitation, to compare with the original line.

To use it, install the app on your phone first, then create a fold in SD card 
root directory named "CPBRs", put the video file and srt file in it(they have to have
the same base name), then click the Floating Action Button(yellow one in the picture).
